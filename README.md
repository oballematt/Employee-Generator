They will be able to add a manager including their name, id number, email and office number. After the user enters the managers information, they will be prompted to add an engineer, intern or add none. If they select engineer or intern, a series of questions will be prompted to the user to input their names, id numbers, emails, github info for engineers, and school attended for intern. If the user selects none, after the manager questions or after the engineer/intern questions, an html page will be generated with all of the information the user has inputed.
